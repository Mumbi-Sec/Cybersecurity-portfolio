# Cybersecurity-portfolio
Hi, Iâ€™m Mwamba Mumbi â€” a cybersecurity graduate specialized in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.  


I have hands-on experience in web application security, network testing, and offensive and defensive security techniques. During my internship, I conducted real-world penetration tests on both live web apps and exposed network infrastructure, helping improve organizational security posture.

I also practice regularly in CTFs, simulate attacks on intentionally vulnerable platforms, and build Bash scripts to automate recon and scanning tasks.

ðŸ’¡ My mission: To help the internet maintain a secure state by thinking like an attacker.  
ðŸ”Ž My mindset: curious, persistent, and always sharpening my skills.

Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, or hack something together.
