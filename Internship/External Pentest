1. Scope
External facing ip addresses:
Range: 166.*.*.1 - 165.*.*.50

Tools Used
- Sublist3r
- Whois
- wpscan
- Dig
- Gobuster

2. Findings
 a. Information Disclosure via WHOis
  Category: Information Disclosure
  Public WHOIS records revealed sensitive information such as email addresses,phone numbers and registrant names.
  <The screenshot for this particular scan revealed too much sensitive information>
  Command:â””â”€$ whois Target-URL
  Information Discovered included:
  - Registrant email
  - Registrant telephone
  - Registrant name
  - Tech email
  and much more....

  b. Exposed nameservers
  Category:Reconnaissance
  Two publicly listed nameservers where identified, which could potentially be used for subdomain enumeration.
  Command:â””â”€$ dnsenum Target-url
