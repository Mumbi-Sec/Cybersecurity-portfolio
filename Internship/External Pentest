# External Network Penetration Test â€“ Internship Project

Date: 
Environment:External-facing infrastructure  
Goal: Assess security of public IPs and identify vulnerabilities

---
1. Scope
External facing ip addresses:
Range: 166.*.*.1 - 165.*.*.50

Tools Used
- Nmap
- Sublist3r
- Whois
- wpscan
- Sqlmap
- Dig
- Gobuster

###Findings
1. Information Disclosure via WHOis
  Category: Information Disclosure
  Public WHOIS records revealed sensitive information such as email addresses,phone numbers and registrant names.
 

2. Exposed nameservers
  Category:Reconnaissance
  Two publicly listed nameservers where identified, which could potentially be used for subdomain enumeration.

3. Accessible Admin Panel
  Category: Misconfiguration/potential unauthorised access control
  Discovered an exposed WordPress admin panel via directory brute-forcing

4. Sensitive files discovered via Gobuster
  Category: Sensitive File Exposure
  Found accessible files

5. Outdated wordpress template

### Summary of Findings
- Open FTP port with anonymous login enabled
- Outdated SSH version with known CVEs
- Weak password detected via brute force

### Outcome
A report was delivered with risk ratings and recommendations. Weak credentials were immediately changed, and port 21 was disabled.

### Key Lessons
- Real-world pentests require careful documentation and diplomacy
- Small misconfigurations can lead to big risks
