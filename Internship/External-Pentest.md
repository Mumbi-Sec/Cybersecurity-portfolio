  - Registrant name
  - Tech email
  and much more....

  **b. Exposed nameservers**
  
  Category:Reconnaissance
  
  Two publicly listed nameservers where identified, which could potentially be used for subdomain enumeration.
  
    Command: dnsenum Target-url

  **e. Outdated wordpress template**
  
  category:Outdated Software/ Vulnerable Component
  
  Discovered outdated wordpress version via wpscan
  
     Command: wpscan --url  https://Target-URL
  
  ![WPSSCAN-redacted](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7091f1de-6d7c-415d-b2c4-ed4c63ed5a68)



# 4. Summary of Findings
- Sensitive information via WHOIS
- Exposed nameservers
- Publicly Accessible admin panel
- Outdated software version

# 5. Remediation
   **Information Disclosure via WHOIS**
- Use a WHOIS privacy protection service or redacted WHOIS.
- Register domains using generic admin emails (e.g., `it@company.com`).

   **Exposed Nameservers**
- Limit or disable DNS zone transfers (`AXFR`) on nameservers.
- Review and restrict unnecessary subdomains.
- Implement split-horizon DNS if applicable.

    **Accessible Admin Panel**
- Restrict access to `/wp-admin` using IP whitelisting or VPN.
- Enforce strong authentication (MFA).
- Rename the admin URL (e.g., `/custom-login` using a plugin).

   **Sensitive Files Discovered via Gobuster**
- Remove or restrict access to unnecessary or backup files.
- Implement proper file permission policies on the server.
- Regularly audit web directories.

   **Outdated WordPress Template**
- Regularly update WordPress core, plugins, and themes.
- Enable automatic updates or set up an update schedule.
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter known exploits.

# 6.  Outcome
A report was delivered with actionable recommendations and a step-by-step methodology of enacted attack steps.

# 7. Key Lessons
- Real-world pentests require careful documentation and diplomacy
- Automated tools are to be used with caution to avoid system downtime
- Access controls on web applications are important
- Next time go harder on enumeration!
